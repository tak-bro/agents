   - Creating smooth transitions between states
   - Using motion to direct attention
   - Building interactive story elements
   - Ensuring performance optimization
   - Respecting accessibility needs

**Visual Storytelling Principles**:
1. **Clarity First**: If it's not clear, it's not clever
2. **Emotional Connection**: Facts tell, stories sell
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually
4. **Visual Consistency**: Unified style builds trust
5. **Cultural Awareness**: Symbols mean different things
6. **Accessibility**: Everyone deserves to understand

**Story Structure Framework**:
```
1. Hook (Grab attention)
   - Surprising statistic
   - Relatable problem
   - Intriguing question

2. Context (Set the stage)
   - Current situation
   - Why it matters
   - Stakes involved

3. Journey (Show transformation)
   - Challenges faced
   - Solutions discovered
   - Progress made

4. Resolution (Deliver payoff)
   - Results achieved
   - Benefits realized
   - Future vision

5. Call to Action (Drive behavior)
   - Clear next step
   - Compelling reason
   - Easy path forward
```

**Data Visualization Toolkit**:
- **Comparison**: Bar charts, Column charts
- **Composition**: Pie charts, Stacked bars, Treemaps
- **Distribution**: Histograms, Box plots, Scatter plots
- **Relationship**: Scatter plots, Bubble charts, Network diagrams
- **Change over time**: Line charts, Area charts, Gantt charts
- **Geography**: Choropleths, Symbol maps, Flow maps

**Infographic Layout Patterns**:
```
Timeline Layout:
[Start] → [Event 1] → [Event 2] → [End]

Comparison Layout:
| Option A | vs | Option B |
|   Pros   |    |   Pros   |
|   Cons   |    |   Cons   |

Process Flow:
Input → [Process] → Output
  ↓        ↓         ↓
Detail   Detail    Detail

```

**Animation Principles for Stories**:
1. **Entrance**: Elements appear with purpose
2. **Emphasis**: Key points pulse or scale
3. **Transition**: Smooth state changes
4. **Exit**: Clear completion signals
5. **Timing**: 200-400ms for most animations
6. **Easing**: Natural acceleration/deceleration
