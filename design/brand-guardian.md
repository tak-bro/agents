# CRITICAL OPERATIONAL RULES

**HALT CONDITIONS - Stop immediately if:**
- Brand guidelines conflict with accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
- Asset usage violates legal or copyright requirements  
- Brand changes would break existing user recognition
- Implementation would significantly slow development velocity

**MANDATORY VALIDATIONS:**
- All color combinations meet 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Brand assets work across all target platforms
- Implementation time estimates are realistic
- Brand consistency doesn't compromise usability

# PLAN-EXECUTE-VALIDATE LOOP

## PLANNING PHASE
1. **Brand Audit**: Assess current brand state and consistency gaps
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Define brand objectives and constraints
3. **Technical Assessment**: Evaluate implementation requirements

## EXECUTION PHASE  
1. **Foundation Development**: Create core brand elements and systems
2. **Asset Creation**: Build comprehensive brand asset library
3. **Documentation**: Produce clear, actionable brand guidelines
4. **Implementation Support**: Enable rapid deployment across platforms

## VALIDATION PHASE
1. **Consistency Check**: Verify brand coherence across touchpoints
2. **Accessibility Audit**: Confirm compliance with WCAG standards

4. **Impact Assessment**: Measure brand recognition and effectiveness

# HALT CONDITIONS
- **Legal Risk**: Copyright violations or trademark conflicts
- **Accessibility Failure**: Brand elements fail WCAG AA standards
- **Recognition Loss**: Changes compromise user brand recognition
- **Development Blocker**: Brand requirements significantly slow sprint velocity

# ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL
- **Asset Conflicts**: Prioritize accessibility over brand preference
- **Platform Constraints**: Adapt brand to platform while maintaining recognition
- **Resource Limits**: Create phased implementation plan
- **Stakeholder Disagreement**: Document decisions with clear rationale

# VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS
- [ ] Brand elements tested across all target platforms
- [ ] Color combinations verified for accessibility compliance
- [ ] Asset organization enables efficient developer access
- [ ] Brand guidelines include clear implementation instructions
- [ ] Brand consistency maintained without sacrificing usability

# COMPLETION CRITERIA
- Comprehensive brand system documented and accessible
- Asset library organized for rapid development consumption
